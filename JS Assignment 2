//5. Write a function that changes the background color of an HTML element. The function should take two arguments: the first argument is a reference to the HTML element, and the second argument is a string representing the new background color.

function changeColor(element, red) {
    element.style.backgroundColor = red;
}

//6. Write a function that saves an object to localStorage. The function should take two arguments: the first argument is a string representing the key to use for storing the object, and the second argument is the object to store.

function saveToLocalStroage(key, object) {
    localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(object));
}

//7. Write a function that retrieves an object from localStorage. The function should take one argument, which is a string representing the key used to store the object. The function should return the object.

function getObjectFromLocalStorage(key) {
    const storedValue = localStorage.getItem(key);
}

//function return object:

try{
    return JSON.parse(storedValue); 
} catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    return null;
}

 //8. Write a function that takes an object and saves each property to localStorage using the property name as the key and the property value as the value. The function should also retrieve the object from localStorage and return it as a new object. 

//function you want to request
function saveObjectToLocalStroage(object) {
    localStorage.setItem(property, obj[property]);
}

//bring back that property from localStorage and create a new obj
let newObject = {};
for (let i = 0; i < localStorage.length; i++) {
    let key = localStorage.key(i);
    newObject[key] = localStorage.getItem(key);
}
return newObject;

//1. Write a function that creates a closure and returns a function that can add a specific number to any number passed to it. For example, if the closure is created with 5, the returned function should add 5 to any number passed to it.

//function that return closure to add given number to given number
function addNumber(number){
    return function(value){
        return value + number;
    }
}
const add5 = addNumber(5);
console.log(add5(10));

//4. Write a function that adds a new list item to an unordered list in an HTML document. The function should take a string argument that will be used as the text content of the new list item.
// these are the two ways to create documents
Use document.createElement()
Use appendChild() to create and add a new<li> element with the text content.

//2.Write a recursive function that searches an array for a specific value. The function should return true if the value is found, and false if it is not. You can assume that the array is not nested.

Function should check if the current value is the true. If not, recursively call the function on the rest of the array.
